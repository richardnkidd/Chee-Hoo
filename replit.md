## Overview

Kamaʻāina Compass is a React-based web application that provides real-time information about Honolulu, Hawaii. The application displays weather conditions, tide data, movie showtimes, and local events in a modern, mobile-first dashboard interface featuring an enhanced ocean-themed design system. It's built as a full-stack application with Express.js backend and React frontend, optimized for deployment on Replit.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with dark theme and custom Honolulu color palette
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui component system
- **State Management**: SWR for data fetching and caching, React Query for additional query management
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints serving JSON data
- **Data Fetching**: External API integrations for real-time data
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with structured error responses
- **Development**: Hot module replacement with Vite middleware integration

### Data Flow
1. Frontend components make API requests through SWR hooks
2. Express server routes handle requests and call appropriate service functions
3. Service functions fetch data from external APIs (weather, tides, events, movies)
4. Data is processed, cached, and returned to the frontend
5. Frontend displays data with loading states and error handling

## Key Components

### Data Services
- **Weather Service**: Integrates with OpenWeatherMap API for current conditions and forecasts
- **Tides Service**: Uses NOAA API for tide predictions and current water levels
- **Movies Service**: Web scraping for local theater showtimes
- **Events Service**: Eventbrite API integration for local events

### Frontend Components
- **WeatherCard**: Displays current weather and 3-day forecast
- **TideCard**: Shows current tide status and upcoming tide times
- **MoviesCard**: Lists movie showtimes at local theaters
- **EventsCard**: Displays upcoming local events with pricing

### UI Features
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with desktop optimization
- **Dark Theme**: Custom Honolulu-inspired color palette
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatic data refreshing with configurable intervals
- **Offline Support**: Cached data display when network is unavailable
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling and user feedback

## Data Storage Solutions

### Database Configuration
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Schema**: User management with extensible design
- **Migrations**: Automated database schema management
- **Environment**: Database URL configuration for Neon/PostgreSQL

### Caching Strategy
- **SWR**: Client-side caching with automatic revalidation
- **Refresh Intervals**: Optimized based on data type (weather: 15min, tides: 30min, movies: 24hr, events: 6hr)
- **Error Recovery**: Fallback to cached data on API failures

## External Dependencies

### Required API Keys
- **OpenWeatherMap**: Weather data (current and forecast)
- **Eventbrite**: Local events data
- **NOAA**: Tide predictions (public API, no key required)

### Core Libraries
- **React Ecosystem**: React, React DOM, React Query, SWR
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI, Tailwind CSS, Lucide React icons
- **Backend**: Express, Axios, Cheerio (web scraping)
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM, Neon Database
- **Development**: Vite, TypeScript, ESLint

### Data Sources
- OpenWeatherMap API for weather data
- NOAA Tides and Currents API for tide information
- Eventbrite API for local events
- Web scraping for movie theater showtimes

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
1. **Development**: `npm run dev` - Vite dev server with HMR
2. **Build**: `npm run build` - Vite frontend build + esbuild server bundle
3. **Production**: `npm start` - Serves built application

### Environment Configuration
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via DATABASE_URL environment variable
- **APIs**: API keys configured through environment variables
- **Deployment**: Optimized for Replit with `.replit` configuration

### Production Considerations
- Static asset serving through Express
- Environment-specific error handling
- Database connection pooling
- API rate limiting considerations
